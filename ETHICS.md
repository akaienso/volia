# VOLIA.one: Philosophy & Architecture

## Core Principle
Language learning should not require surrendering identity, data, or autonomy.

## Privacy by Architecture
- **Local-First Storage**: Progress for core learning tools is stored exclusively on the user's device.
- **No Account by Default**: Users can learn indefinitely without a sign-in or personal data extraction.
- **Data Portability**: Supports identity-free data transfer via non-proprietary JSON export and QR-code-based transfer.

## Product Structure
### Free Version (No Account Required)
- Flashcards with pronunciation audio.
- Unlimited custom vocabulary lists.
- Scheduled study sessions and reminders.

### Paid Version (Optional)
- Covers ongoing infrastructure costs for compute-intensive features.
- Includes regional pronunciation, voice selection, and AI conversation practice.

## Ethics & Analytics
VOLIA tracks **usage, not users**. We measure aggregate app launches and feature demand to plan infrastructure, but never profile learners or collect location data.
